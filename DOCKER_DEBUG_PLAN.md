# Docker Desktop Debugging Plan

## Current Issue
Docker Desktop processes are running but Docker Engine isn't accessible via named pipe. This is a recurring issue that happens after killing processes or restarting services.

## Debugging Strategy

### Phase 1: Diagnose Current State
1. **Check Docker processes** - Verify what's actually running
2. **Test Docker connectivity** - Try different Docker commands
3. **Check WSL2 integration** - Verify Docker-WSL2 connection
4. **Examine Docker settings** - Check configuration state

### Phase 2: Track Failure Pattern
1. **Document when it fails** - After process kills, restarts, etc.
2. **Note error messages** - Exact pipe/connectivity errors
3. **Track what fixes it** - Docker Desktop restart, Windows restart, etc.
4. **Time to recovery** - How long until Docker becomes accessible

### Phase 3: Find Reliable Fix
1. **Test Docker restart methods** - GUI vs CLI vs service restart
2. **Check startup timing** - How long Docker needs to fully initialize
3. **Verify WSL2 backend** - Ensure proper WSL integration
4. **Document working sequence** - Exact steps that restore connectivity

## Tracking Checklist
- [ ] Docker Desktop GUI status
- [ ] Docker service status in Windows
- [ ] WSL2 docker-desktop distro status
- [ ] Named pipe availability
- [ ] Time from restart to connectivity
- [ ] What triggered the failure
- [ ] What restored connectivity

## Success Metrics
- Docker commands work consistently
- Containers can be started/stopped
- Database container runs reliably
- Quick recovery when issues occur

## Debug Log

### Session 1: Initial Failure
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-13 17:56
**Trigger**: After `npx kill-port` and process kills
**Error**: `open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified`
**Docker Desktop Status**: Processes running (tasklist shows Docker Desktop.exe)
**Fix Attempted**: Docker Desktop restart via Start menu
**Result**: SUCCESS after ~5 minutes
**Recovery Time**: ~5 minutes from restart to full connectivity

### Key Findings:
1. **Docker Desktop processes running â‰  Docker Engine accessible**
   - `tasklist` shows Docker Desktop.exe processes
   - But named pipe not available immediately
   
2. **Recovery Pattern**:
   - Docker Desktop GUI restart required
   - Takes 3-5 minutes for full initialization
   - WSL2 integration needs time to establish
   
3. **Current Working State**:
   - PostgreSQL on port 5433 (container)
   - Backend on port 3011 (container)
   - Frontend on port 3010 (local dev server)
